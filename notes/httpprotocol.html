            <p>A lot of smartphone apps use HTTP under the hood to send requests and receive data. Web browsers are just the most common — and complicated — user interface for web technology.</p>

            <p>But browsers are not the only web client around. HTTP is powerful and widely supported in software, so it's a common choice for programs that need to talk to each other across the network, even if they don't look anything like a web browser.</p>

             <p>The Python http.server module, can run a built-in web server on your computer. It's not a web app you'd publish to the world; it's a demonstration of Python's HTTP abilities. </p>

                 <p>This may not seem like much of a big deal — after all, if you just wanted to access files on your local computer in your browser, you could use file:// URIs. But the demo server is actually a web server. If you have another computer on the same local network, you could use it to access files served up by this server.</p>

                 <p>When you put localhost:8000 in your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the Python program you're running. That program responds with a piece of data, which your browser presents to you. In this case, it's showing you a directory listing as a piece of HTML. Use your browser's developer tools to look at the HTML that it sends.</p>
                 
                 <p>Note: If you have a file called <strong class="theCode">index.html</strong> in that directory, you'll see the contents of that file in your browser instead of the directory listing. Move that file somewhere else and reload the page, and you will see the directory listing like the one above.</p>

                 <p>404 is the HTTP status code for "Not Found". On Highway 101, not far from the Udacity office in Mountain View, there's a sign that tells the distance to Los Angeles.

                 <p> When you start a server program, it waits for clients to connect to it — like the demo server waiting for your web browser to ask it for a page. Then when a connection comes in, the server runs a piece of code — like calling a function — to handle each incoming connection. A connection in this sense is like a phone call: it's a channel through which the client and server can talk to each other. Web clients send requests over these connections, and servers send responses back.</p>

From a web user's view, a URI is a piece of text that you put into your web browser that tells it what page to go to.

But don't worry too much about the distinction.</blockquote>

		     <p class="card-text">A URI is a name for a resource — such as this lesson page, or a Wikipedia article, or a data source like the Google Maps API. URIs are made out of several different parts, each of which has its own syntax. Many of these parts are optional, which is why URIs for different services look so different from one another.</p>

File URIs tell the client to access a file on the local filesystem. HTTP and HTTPS URIs point to resources served by a web server.</p>

                 <p>HTTP and HTTPS URIs look almost the same. The difference is that when a client goes to access a resource with an HTTPS URI, it will use an encrypted connection to do it. Encrypted Web connections were originally used to protect passwords and credit-card transactions, but today many sites use them to help protect users' privacy.

		     <p class="card-text">In an HTTP URI, the next thing that appears after the scheme is a hostname — something like www.udacity.com or localhost. This tells the client which server to connect to.</p>

                <p>You'll often see web addresses written as just a hostname in print. But in the HTML code of a web page, you can't write <strong class="theCode">&lt;a href="www.google.com"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;</strong> and get a working link to Google. A hostname can only appear after a URI scheme that supports it, such as http or https. In these URIs, there will always be a :// between the scheme and hostname.</p>

                 <p>We'll see more about hostnames later on in the lesson. By the way, not every URI has a hostname. For instance, a mailto URI just has an email address: <strong class="theCode">mailto:spam@example.net</strong> is a well-formed mailto URI. This also reveals a bit more about the punctuation in URIs: the : goes after the scheme, but the // goes before the hostname. Mailto links don't have a hostname part, so they don't have a //.

		     <p class="card-text">In an HTTP URI (and many others), the next thing that appears is the path, which identifies a particular resource on a server. A server can have many resources on it — such as different web pages, videos, or APIs. The path tells the server which resource the client is looking for.</p>

                <p>On the demo server, the paths you see will correspond to files on your filesystem. But that's just the demo server. In the real world, URI paths don't necessarily equate to specific filenames. For instance, if you do a Google search, you'll see a URI path such as <strong class="theCode">/search?q=ponies</strong>. This doesn't mean that there's literally a file on a server at Google with a filename of <strong class="theCode">search?q=ponies</strong>. The server interprets the path to figure out what resource to send. In the case of a search query, it sends back a search result page that maybe never existed before.</p>

                 <p>When you write a URI without a path, such as <strong class="theCode">http://udacity.com,</strong>  the browser fills in the default path, which is written with a single slash. That's why <strong class="theCode">http://udacity.com </strong> is the same as <strong class="theCode">http://udacity.com/ </strong>(with a slash on the end).//.

                 <blockquote class="blockquote">
                 The path written with just a single slash is also called the root. When you look at the root URI of the demo server — <strong class="theCode"> http://localhost:8000/ </strong>— you're not looking at the root of your computer's whole filesystem. It's just the root of the resources served by the web server. The demo server won't let a web browser access files outside the directory that it's running in.

		     <p class="card-text">URIs like this one don't have a scheme, or a hostname — just a path. This is a relative URI reference. It's "relative" to the context in which it appears — specifically, the page it's on. This URI doesn't include the hostname or port of the server it's on, but the browser can figure that out from context. If you click on one of those links, the browser knows from context that it needs to fetch it from the same server that it got the original page from.</p>

             <p>There are many other parts that can occur in a URI. Consider the difference between these two Wikipedia URIs:</p>
                 <u>
		         <li> <a class="card-title theCode" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen " target="_blank"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen </a></li>
                <li> <a class="card-title theCode" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen#Discovery" target="_blank"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen#Discovery </a></li>
                 </u>
		     <p class="card-text">If you follow these links in your browser, it will fetch the same page from Wikipedia's web server. But the second one displays the page scrolled to the section about the discovery of oxygen. The part of the URI after the <strong class="theCode">#</strong> sign is called a <strong class="theCode">fragment</strong>. The browser doesn't even send it to the web server. It lets a link point to a specific named part of a resource; in HTML pages it links to an element by id.</p>
