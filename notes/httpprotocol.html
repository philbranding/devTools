            <p>A lot of smartphone apps use HTTP under the hood to send requests and receive data. Web browsers are just the most common — and complicated — user interface for web technology.</p>

            <p>But browsers are not the only web client around. HTTP is powerful and widely supported in software, so it's a common choice for programs that need to talk to each other across the network, even if they don't look anything like a web browser.</p>

             <p>The Python http.server module, can run a built-in web server on your computer. It's not a web app you'd publish to the world; it's a demonstration of Python's HTTP abilities. </p>

                 <p>This may not seem like much of a big deal — after all, if you just wanted to access files on your local computer in your browser, you could use file:// URIs. But the demo server is actually a web server. If you have another computer on the same local network, you could use it to access files served up by this server.</p>

                 <p>When you put localhost:8000 in your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the Python program you're running. That program responds with a piece of data, which your browser presents to you. In this case, it's showing you a directory listing as a piece of HTML. Use your browser's developer tools to look at the HTML that it sends.</p>
                 
                 <p>Note: If you have a file called <strong class="theCode">index.html</strong> in that directory, you'll see the contents of that file in your browser instead of the directory listing. Move that file somewhere else and reload the page, and you will see the directory listing like the one above.</p>

                 <p>404 is the HTTP status code for "Not Found". On Highway 101, not far from the Udacity office in Mountain View, there's a sign that tells the distance to Los Angeles.

                 <p> When you start a server program, it waits for clients to connect to it — like the demo server waiting for your web browser to ask it for a page. Then when a connection comes in, the server runs a piece of code — like calling a function — to handle each incoming connection. A connection in this sense is like a phone call: it's a channel through which the client and server can talk to each other. Web clients send requests over these connections, and servers send responses back.</p>

From a web user's view, a URI is a piece of text that you put into your web browser that tells it what page to go to.

But don't worry too much about the distinction.</blockquote>

		     <p class="card-text">A URI is a name for a resource — such as this lesson page, or a Wikipedia article, or a data source like the Google Maps API. URIs are made out of several different parts, each of which has its own syntax. Many of these parts are optional, which is why URIs for different services look so different from one another.</p>

File URIs tell the client to access a file on the local filesystem. HTTP and HTTPS URIs point to resources served by a web server.</p>

                 <p>HTTP and HTTPS URIs look almost the same. The difference is that when a client goes to access a resource with an HTTPS URI, it will use an encrypted connection to do it. Encrypted Web connections were originally used to protect passwords and credit-card transactions, but today many sites use them to help protect users' privacy.

		     <p class="card-text">In an HTTP URI, the next thing that appears after the scheme is a hostname — something like www.udacity.com or localhost. This tells the client which server to connect to.</p>

                <p>You'll often see web addresses written as just a hostname in print. But in the HTML code of a web page, you can't write <strong class="theCode">&lt;a href="www.google.com"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;</strong> and get a working link to Google. A hostname can only appear after a URI scheme that supports it, such as http or https. In these URIs, there will always be a :// between the scheme and hostname.</p>

                 <p>We'll see more about hostnames later on in the lesson. By the way, not every URI has a hostname. For instance, a mailto URI just has an email address: <strong class="theCode">mailto:spam@example.net</strong> is a well-formed mailto URI. This also reveals a bit more about the punctuation in URIs: the : goes after the scheme, but the // goes before the hostname. Mailto links don't have a hostname part, so they don't have a //.

		     <p class="card-text">In an HTTP URI (and many others), the next thing that appears is the path, which identifies a particular resource on a server. A server can have many resources on it — such as different web pages, videos, or APIs. The path tells the server which resource the client is looking for.</p>

                <p>On the demo server, the paths you see will correspond to files on your filesystem. But that's just the demo server. In the real world, URI paths don't necessarily equate to specific filenames. For instance, if you do a Google search, you'll see a URI path such as <strong class="theCode">/search?q=ponies</strong>. This doesn't mean that there's literally a file on a server at Google with a filename of <strong class="theCode">search?q=ponies</strong>. The server interprets the path to figure out what resource to send. In the case of a search query, it sends back a search result page that maybe never existed before.</p>

                 <p>When you write a URI without a path, such as <strong class="theCode">http://udacity.com,</strong>  the browser fills in the default path, which is written with a single slash. That's why <strong class="theCode">http://udacity.com </strong> is the same as <strong class="theCode">http://udacity.com/ </strong>(with a slash on the end).//.

                 <blockquote class="blockquote">
                 The path written with just a single slash is also called the root. When you look at the root URI of the demo server — <strong class="theCode"> http://localhost:8000/ </strong>— you're not looking at the root of your computer's whole filesystem. It's just the root of the resources served by the web server. The demo server won't let a web browser access files outside the directory that it's running in.

		     <p class="card-text">URIs like this one don't have a scheme, or a hostname — just a path. This is a relative URI reference. It's "relative" to the context in which it appears — specifically, the page it's on. This URI doesn't include the hostname or port of the server it's on, but the browser can figure that out from context. If you click on one of those links, the browser knows from context that it needs to fetch it from the same server that it got the original page from.</p>

             <p>There are many other parts that can occur in a URI. Consider the difference between these two Wikipedia URIs:</p>
                 <u>
		         <li> <a class="card-title theCode" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen " target="_blank"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen </a></li>
                <li> <a class="card-title theCode" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen#Discovery" target="_blank"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen#Discovery </a></li>
                 </u>
		     <p class="card-text">If you follow these links in your browser, it will fetch the same page from Wikipedia's web server. But the second one displays the page scrolled to the section about the discovery of oxygen. The part of the URI after the <strong class="theCode">#</strong> sign is called a <strong class="theCode">fragment</strong>. The browser doesn't even send it to the web server. It lets a link point to a specific named part of a resource; in HTML pages it links to an element by id.</p>
                 
                 <p>In contrast, consider this Google Search URI:</p>
                 
                 <ul>
                     <li> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fish" target="_blank" class="theCode">https://www.google.com/search?q=fish  </a></li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>The <strong class="theCode">?q=fish</strong> is a query part of the URI. This does get sent to the server.</p>
                 
                 <p>There are a few other possible parts of a URI. For way more detail than you need for this course, take a look at this Wikipedia article:</p>

                 <p>A full HTTP or HTTPS URI includes the hostname of the web server, like  <strong class="theCode">www.udacity.com </strong>or  <strong class="theCode">www.un.int </strong>or <strong class="theCode">www.cheeseboardcollective.coop</strong> (my favorite pizza place in the world, in Berkeley CA). A hostname in a URI can also be an IP address: for instance, if you put <a class="theCode" href="http://216.58.194.174/" target="_blank">http://216.58.194.174/</a> in your browser, you'll end up at Google.</p>
                 
                 <blockquote class="blockquote">Why is it called a hostname? In network terminology, a host is a computer on the network; one that could host services.</blockquote>
                 
                 
		     <p class="card-text">The Internet tells computers apart by their <strong class="theCode">IP Addresses</strong>; every piece of network traffic on the Internet is labeled with the IP addresses of the sending and receiving computers. In order to connect to a web server such as www.udacity.com, a client needs to translate the hostname into an IP address. Your operating system's network configuration uses the Domain Name Service (DNS) — a set of servers maintained by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other network users — to look up hostnames and get back IP addresses.</p>
                 
                 <p class="theCode">$ host www.google.com</p>
                 <p class="theCode">$ nslookup www.google.com</p>
                 
                 <ul>
                     <li> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fish" target="_blank" class="theCode">https://www.google.com/search?q=fish  </a></li>
                 </ul>
                 <p><strong class="theCode">$ nslookup localhost </strong></p>
                 
                 <p>Localhost is 127.0.0.1. Well, that's IPv4 localhost, anyway. IPv6 localhost is ::1, which is short for 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001.</p>
                 
                 <h2>IPv4 or IPv6</h2>
                 
                 <p>IP addresses come in two different varieties: the older IPv4 and the newer IPv6. When you see an address like 127.0.0.1 or 216.58.194.164, those are IPv4 addresses. IPv6 addresses are much longer, such as 2607:f8b0:4005:804::2004, although they can also be abbreviated.</p>
                 
                 <h2>Localhost</h2>
                 
                 <p> The IPv4 address 127.0.0.1 and the IPv6 address ::1 are special addresses that mean "this computer itself" — for when a client (like your browser) is accessing a server on your own computer. The hostname localhost refers to these special addresses.</p>
                 
                 <p>When you run the demo server, it prints a message saying that it's listening on 0.0.0.0. This is not a regular IP address. Instead, it's a special code for "every IPv4 address on this computer". That includes the localhost address, but it also includes your computer's regular IP address.</p>
                 
                 <blockquote class="blockquote">A single web server can have lots of different web sites running on it, each with their own hostname. When a client asks the server for a resource, it has to specify what hostname it intends to be talking to. </blockquote>
                 
                 <h2>Ports</h2>
                 
                 <p>When you told your browser to connect to the demo server, you gave it the URI http://localhost:8000/. This URI has a port number of 8000. But most of the web addresses you see in the wild don't have a port number on them. This is because the client usually figures out the port number from the URI scheme.</p>
                 
                 <p>For instance, HTTP URIs imply a port number of 80, whereas HTTPS URIs imply a port number of 443. Your Python demo web server is running on port 8000. Since this isn't the default port, you have to write the port number in URIs for it.</p>
                 
                 <p> <strong class="theCode">What's a port number, anyway?</strong> To get into that, we need to talk about how the Internet works. All of the network traffic that computers send and receive — everything from web requests, to login sessions, to file sharing — is split up into messages called <strong class="theCode">packets.</strong> Each packet has the IP addresses of the computer that sent it, and the computer that receives it. And (with the exception of some low-level packets, such as ping) it also has the <strong class="theCode">port number</strong> for the sender and recipient. IP addresses distinguish computers; port numbers distinguish programs on those computers.</p>
                 
                 <p>We say that a server "listens on" a port, such as 80 or 8000. "Listening" means that when the server starts up, it tells its operating system that it wants to receive connections from clients on a particular port number. When a client (such as a web browser) "connects to" that port and sends a request, the operating system knows to forward that request to the server that's listening on that port.</p>
                 
                 <blockquote class="blockquote">Why do we use port 8000 instead of 80 for the demo server? For historical reasons, operating systems only allow the administrator (or root) account to listen on ports below 1024. This is fine for production web servers, but it's not convenient for learning.</blockquote>
                 
                 <p class="theCode">The URI in the question is an HTTPS URI. The default port for HTTPS is port 443.</p>

             <p>There are a lot of different types of HTTP requests. Every HTTP Request contains a VERB or Method which tels the server what kind of request the client is requesting  </p>
                 
            <h2>GET </h2>
                
            <p>What browser use when they ask a server to send them a copy of a resource.</p>
                 
		     <p class="card-text">Take a look back at the server logs on your terminal, where the demo server is running. When you request a page from the demo server, an entry appears in the logs with a message like this:</p>
                 
                 <p class="theCode">127.0.0.1 - - [03/Oct/2016 15:45:50] "GET /readme.png HTTP/1.1" 200 -</p>
                
                 <p>Take a look at the part right after the date and time. Here, it says "GET /readme.png HTTP/1.1". This is the text of the request line that the browser sent to the server. This log entry is the server telling you that it received a request that said, literally, GET /readme.png HTTP/1.1.</p>
                 
                 <p>TThis request has three parts.</p>
                 
                 <ul>
                     <li>The word GET is the method or HTTP verb being used; this says what kind of request is being made. GET is the verb that clients use when they want a server to send a resource, such as a web page or image. Later, we'll see other verbs that are used when a client wants to do other things, such as submit a form or make changes to a resource. </li>
                     
                     <li>/readme.png is the path of the resource being requested. Notice that the client does not send the whole URI of the resource here. It doesn't say https://localhost:8000/readme.png. It just sends the path. </li>
                     
                     <li>/Finally, HTTP/1.1 is the protocol of the request. Over the years, there have been several changes to the way HTTP works. Clients have to tell servers which dialect of HTTP they're speaking. HTTP/1.1 is the most common version today. </li>
                 </ul>

The status line tells the client whether the server understood the request, whether the server has the resource the client asked for, and how to proceed next. It also tells the client which dialect of HTTP the server is speaking.</p>
                 
            <p>The numbers 200 and 301 here are HTTP status codes. There are dozens of different status codes. The first digit of the status code indicates the general success of the request.

                     <li> <strong class="theCode">3xx — Redirection. </strong> The server is telling the client a different URI it should redirect to.

                     <li> <strong class="theCode">4xx — Client error. </strong> The server didn't understand the client's request, or can't or won't fill it. Different codes tell the client whether it was a bad URI, a permissions problem, or another sort of error.</li>
                     <li> <strong class="theCode">5xx — Server error. </strong> Something went wrong on the server side.</li>

             <p>IAn HTTP response can include many headers. Each header is a line that starts with a keyword, such as Location or Content-type, followed by a colon and a value. Headers are a sort of metadata for the response. They aren't displayed by browsers or other clients; instead, they tell the client various information about the response.</p>
                 
            <p>Many, many features of the Web are implemented using headers. For instance, cookies are a Web feature that lets servers store data on the browser, for instance to keep a user logged in. To set a cookie, the server sends the Set-Cookie header. The browser will then send the cookie data back in a Cookie header on subsequent requests. You'll see more about cookies later in this course.</p>
                 
            <p class="theCode">Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8</p>
                 
                
            <h2>Content-type</h2>
                 
		     <p class="card-text">A Content-type header indicates the kind of data that the server is sending. It includes a general category of content as well as the specific format. For instance, a PNG image file will come with the Content-type image/png. If the content is text (including HTML), the server will also tell what encoding it's written in. UTF-8 is a very common choice here, and it's the default for Python text anyway.</p>

            <p> Very often, the headers will contain more metadata about the response body. For instance, both the demo server and Google also send a Content-Length header, which tells the client how long (in bytes) the response body will be. If the server sends this, then the client can reuse the connection to send another request after it's read the first response. Browsers use this so they can fetch multiple pieces of data (such as images on a web page) without having to reconnect to the server.</p>
                 
            <h2>Body Response</h2>
                 
		     <p class="card-text">The headers end with a blank line. Everything after that blank line is part of the response body. If the request was successful (a 200 OK status, for instance), this is a copy of whatever resource the client asked for — such as a web page, image, or other pieces of data.</p>

            <p> But in the case of an error, the response body is where the error message goes! If you request a page that doesn't exist, and you get a 404 Not Found error, the actual error message shows up in the response body.</p>
