	<h1>Deploying to a Hosting Service</h1>
	<h3 class="notes">Can I just host my web service at home? </h3>
    <p> Maybe! Plenty of people do, but not everyone can. It's a common hobbyist activity, but not something that people would usually do for a job.</p>
    
    <p> There's nothing fundamentally special about the computers that run web servers. They're just computers running an operating system such as Linux, Mac OS, or Windows (usually Linux). Their connection to the Internet is a little different from a typical home or mobile Internet connection, though. A server usually needs to have a stable (static) IP address so that clients can find it and connect to it. Most home and mobile systems don't assign your computer a static IP address.</p>
    
    <p> Also, most home Internet routers don't allow incoming connections by default. You would need to reconfigure your router to allow it. This is totally possible, but way beyond the scope of this course (and I don't know what kind of router you have).</p>
    
    <p> Lastly, if you run a web service at home, your computer has to be always on.</p>
    
    <p> So, for the next exercise in this course, you'll be deploying one of your existing web services to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" class="theCode">Heroku </a>, a commercial service that will host it on the web where it will be publicly accessible. </p>

		     <h5 class="card-title theCode">Create configuration files</h5>
		     <p class="card-text"> There are a few configuration files that Heroku requires for deployment, to tell its servers how to run your application. For the case of the bookmark server, I'll just give you the required content for these files. These are just plain text files and can be created in your favorite text editor. </p>
                 
            <p> <strong class="theCode"> runtime.txt </strong> tells Heroku what version of Python you want to run. <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-runtimes" target="_blank" class="theCode">Check the currently supported runtimes in the Heroku documentation; this will change over time!</a> As of early 2020, the currently supported version of Python 3 is python-3.7.2; so this file just needs to contain the text python-3.7.2. </p>
                 
            <p><strong class="theCode">requirements.txt</strong> is used by Heroku (through <strong class="theCode">pip</strong>) to install dependencies of your application that aren't in the Python standard library. The bookmark server has one of these: the <strong class="theCode">requests</strong> module. We'd like a recent version of that, so this file can contain the text <strong class="theCode">requests>=2.12</strong>. This will install version 2.12 or a later version, if one has been released.</p>
                 
            <p><strong class="theCode">Procfile</strong> is used by Heroku to specify the command line for running your application. It can support running multiple servers, but in this case we're only going to run a web server. Check the Heroku documentation about process types for more details. If your bookmark server is in <strong class="theCode">BookmarkServer.py</strong>, then the contents of Procfile should be <strong class="theCode">web: python BookmarkServer.py</strong>.</p>
                 
            <hr>
                 
            <h3>Listen on a configurable port</h3>

            <p>There's one small change that you have to make to your server code to make it run on Heroku. The bookmark server from Lesson 2 listens on port 8000. But Heroku runs many users' processes on the same computer, and multiple processes can't (normally) listen on the same port. So Heroku needs to be able to tell your server what port to listen on.</p>
        
            <p>The way it does this is through an <strong class="theCode">environment variable</strong> — a configuration variable that is passed to your server from the program that starts it, usually the shell. Python code can access environment variables in the <strong class="theCode">os.environ</strong> dictionary. The names of environment variables are usually capitalized; and the environment variable we need here is called, unsurprisingly, <strong class="theCode">PORT</strong>.</p>
                 
            <p>The port your server listens on is configured when it creates the <strong class="theCode">HTTPServer</strong> instance, near the bottom of the server code. We can make it work with or without the <strong class="theCode">PORT</strong> environment variable, like so:</p>
                 
                 <ul>
                    <li class="theCode">if __name__ == '__main__':</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="theCode">port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8000))</li>
                            <li class="theCode">server_address = ('', port)</li>
                            <li class="theCode">httpd = http.server.HTTPServer(server_address, Shortener)</li>
                            <li class="theCode"> httpd.serve_forever()</li>
                        </ul>
                 
                 </ul>
            
            <p> To access <strong class="theCode">os.environ </strong>, you will also need to <strong class="theCode"> import os </strong>at the top of the file. </p>
                 
            <p>Make these changes to your server code, run the server locally to test that it still works, then commit it to your Git repository:</p>

                  
             <ul>
                <li class="theCode">git add BookmarkServer.py</li>
                <li class="theCode">git commit -m "Use PORT from environment."</li>
            </ul>
            
             <hr>
                 
            <h3>Create and push your app</h3>

            <p>Before you can put your service on the web, you have to give it a name. You can call it whatever you want, as long as the name is not already taken by another user! Your app's name will appear in the URI of your deployed service. For instance, if you name your app silly-pony, it will appear on the web at https://silly-pony.herokuapp.com/.</p>
        
            <p> Use <strong class="theCode">heroku create your-app-name</strong> to tell Heroku about your app and give it a name. Again, you can choose any name you like, but it will have to be unique — the service will tell you if you're choosing a name that someone else has already claimed.</p>
                 
            <p>Finally, use <strong class="theCode"> git push heroku master </strong> to deploy the app!</p>

It's pretty straightforward to plug concurrency support into an HTTPServer, though. The Python standard library supports doing this by adding a mixin to the HTTPServer class. A mixin is a sort of helper class, one that adds extra behavior the original class did not have. To do this, you'll need to add this code to your bookmark server:</p>
                 
                <ul>
                    <li class="theCode">import threading</li>

                    <li class="theCode">"This is an HTTPServer that supports thread-based concurrency."</li>
                </ul>
                 
                 <p>Then look at the bottom of your bookmark server code, where it creates an HTTPServer. Have it create a ThreadHTTPServer instead:</p>
                 
                  <ul>
                    <li class="theCode">if __name__ == '__main__':</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="theCode">port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8000))</li>
                            <li class="theCode">server_address = ('', port)</li>
                            <li class="theCode">httpd = ThreadHTTPServer(server_address, Shortener)</li>

                 </ul>
                 
                 <p>Commit this change to your Git repository, and push it to Heroku. Now when you test it out, you should be able to add an entry that points to the service itself.</p>

                 <h3>Static content and more</h3>
                 
                 <p>The Web was originally designed to serve documents, not to deliver applications. Even today, a large amount of the data presented on any web site is static content — images, HTML files, videos, downloadable files, and other media stored on disk.</p>

                 <p>Specialized web server programs — like <a class="theCode" href="https://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache</a>, <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/" target="_blank" class="theCode">Nginx</a>, or <a href="https://www.iis.net/" target="_blank" class="theCode">IIS</a> — can serve static content from disk storage very quickly and efficiently. They can also provide access control, allowing only authenticated users to download particular static content.</p>
                 
                 <h3>Routing and load balancing </h3>
                 
                 <p>Some web applications have several different server components, each running as a separate process. One thing a specialized web server can do is dispatch requests to the particular backend servers that need to handle each request. There are a lot of names for this, including request routing and reverse proxying.</p>
                 
                 <p>Some web applications need to do a lot of work on the server side for each request, and need many servers to handle the load. Splitting requests up among several servers is called load balancing.</p>
                 
                 <p> Load balancing also helps handle conditions where one server becomes unavailable, allowing other servers to pick up the slack. A reverse proxy can health check the backend servers, only sending requests to the ones that are currently up and running. This also makes it possible to do updates to the backend servers without having an outage.</p>  
                 
                 <h3>Concurrent users</h3>
                 
                 <p>Handling a large number of network connections at once turns out to be complicated — even more so than plugging concurrency support into your Python web service.</p>
                 
                 <p>As you may have noticed in your own use of the web, it takes time for a server to respond to a request. The server has to receive and parse the request, come up with the data that it needs to respond, and transmit the response back to the client. The network itself is not instantaneous; it takes time for data to travel from the client to the server.</p>
                 
                 <p>In addition, a browser is totally allowed to open up multiple connections to the same server, for instance to request resources such as images, or to perform API queries.</p>
                 
                 <p> All of this means that if a server is handling many requests per second, there will be many requests in progress at once — literally, at any instant in time. We sometimes refer to these as in-flight requests, meaning that the request has "taken off" from the client, but the response has not "landed" again back at the client. A web service can't just handle one request at a time and then go on to the next one; it has to be able to handle many at once.</p>
                 
                 <h3>Caching</h3>
                 
                 <p>Imagine a web service that does a lot of complicated processing for each request — something like calculating the best route for a trip between two cities on a map. Pretty often, users make the same request repeatedly: imagine if you load up that map, and then you reload the page — or if someone else loads the same map. It's useful if the service can avoid recalculating something it just figured out a second ago. It's also useful if the service can avoid re-sending a large object (such as an image) if it doesn't have to.</p>
                 
                 <p>One way that web services avoid this is by making use of a cache, a temporary storage for resources that are likely to be reused. Web systems can perform caching in a number of places — but all of them are under control of the server that serves up a particular resource. That server can set HTTP headers indicating that a particular resource is not intended to change quickly, and can safely be cached.</p>
                 
                 <p>There are a few places that caching usually can happen. Every user's browser maintains a browser cache of cacheable resources — such as images from recently-viewed web pages. The browser can also be configured to pass requests through a web proxy, which can perform caching on behalf of many users. Finally, a web site can use a reverse proxy to cache results so they don't need to be recomputed by a slower application server or database.</p>
                 
                 <p> All HTTP caching is supposed to be governed by cache control headers set by the server. You can read a lot more about them in this article by Google engineer Ilya Grigorik.</p>
                 
                 <h3>Capacity</h3>
                 
                 <p>hy serve static requests out of cache (or a static web server) rather than out of your application server? Python code is totally capable of sending images or video via HTTP, after all. The reason is that — all else being equal — handling a request faster provides a better user experience, but also makes it possible for your service to support more requests.</p>
                 
                 <p>If your web service becomes popular, you don't want it to bog down under the strain of more traffic. So it helps to handle different kinds of request with software that can perform that function quickly and efficiently.</p>

		     <h3 class="card-title">Cookies </h3>

		          <p class="card-text">Cookies are a way that a server can ask a browser to retain a piece of information, and send it back to the server when the browser makes subsequent requests. Every cookie has a name and a value, much like a variable in your code; it also has rules that specify when the cookie should be sent back.</p>

                 <p> What are cookies for? A few different things. If the server sends each client a unique cookie value, it can use these to tell clients apart. This can be used to implement higher-level concepts on top of HTTP requests and responses — things like sessions and login. Cookies are used by analytics and advertising systems to track user activity from site to site. Cookies are also sometimes used to store user preferences for a site.</p>
                 
                 
                 <h3>How cookies happen</h3>
                 
                 <p>The first time the client makes a request to the server, the server sends back the response with a Set-Cookie header. This header contains three things: a cookie name, a value, and some attributes. Every subsequent time the browser makes a request to the server, it will send that cookie back to the server. The server can update cookies, or ask the browser to expire them.</p>
                 
                 <h3>Seeing cookies in your browser</h3>
                 
                 <p>Browsers don't make it easy to find cookies that have been set, because removing or altering cookies can affect the expected behavior of web services you use. However, it is possible to inspect cookies from sites you use in every major browser. Do some research on your own to find out how to view the cookies that your browser is storing.</p>
                 

                 <blockquote class="blockquote">
                 By the way, if you try to research "cookie fields" with a web search, you may get a lot of results from the Mrs. Fields cookie company. Try "HTTP cookie fields" for more relevant results.
                 </blockquote>
                 
                 <p>The first two, the cookie's name and content, are also called its key and value. They're analogous to a dictionary key and value in Python — or a variable's name and value for that matter. They will both be sent back to the server. There are some syntactic rules for which characters are allowed in a cookie name; for instance, they can't have spaces in them. The value of the cookie is where the "real data" of the cookie goes — for instance, a unique token representing a logged-in user's session.</p>
                 
                 <p>The next two fields, Domain and Path, describe the scope of the cookie — that is to say, which queries will include it. By default, the domain of a cookie is the hostname from the URI of the response that set the cookie. But a server can also set a cookie on a broader domain, within limits. For instance, a response from <strong class="theCode">www.udacity.com</strong> can set a cookie for <strong class="theCode">udacity.com</strong>, but not for <strong class="theCode">com</strong>.</p>
                 
                 <p>The fields that Chrome describes as "Send for" and "Accessible to script" are internally called Secure and HttpOnly, and they are boolean flags (true or false values). The internal names are a little bit misleading. If the Secure flag is set, then the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS (encrypted) connections, not plain HTTP. If the HttpOnly flag is set, then the cookie will not be accessible to JavaScript code running on the page.</p>
                 
                 <p>Finally, the last two fields deal with the lifetime of the cookie — how long it should last. The creation time is just the time of the response that set the cookie. The expiration time is when the server wants the browser to stop saving the cookie. There are two different ways a server can set this: it can set an Expires field with a specific date and time, or a Max-Age field with a number of seconds. If no expiration field is set, then a cookie is expired when the browser closes.</p>
                 
                 <h3> Using cookies in Python </h3>
                 
                 <p>To set a cookie from a Python HTTP server, all you need to do is set the <strong class="theCode"> Set-Cookie</strong> header on an HTTP response. Similarly, to read a cookie in an incoming request, you read the <strong class="theCode">Cookie</strong> header. However, the format of these headers is a little bit tricky; I don't recommend formatting them by hand. Python's <strong class="theCode">http.cookies</strong> module provides handy utilities for doing so. </p>
                 
                 <p>To create a cookie on a Python server, use the <strong class="theCode">SimpleCookie</strong> class. This class is based on a dictionary, but has some special behavior once you create a key within it:</p>
                 
                 <ul>
                     <li class="theCode"> from http.cookies import SimpleCookie, CookieError </li>
                     <p></p>
                     <li class="theCode"> out_cookie = SimpleCookie()</li>
                     <li class="theCode">out_cookie["bearname"] = "Smokey Bear"</li>
                     <li class="theCode">out_cookie["bearname"]["max-age"] = 600</li>
                     <li class="theCode">out_cookie["bearname"]["httponly"] = True</li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 
                 <p>Then you can send the cookie as a header from your request handler:</p>
                 
                 <p class="theCode">self.send_header("Set-Cookie", out_cookie["bearname"].OutputString())</p>
                 
                 <p>To read incoming cookies, create a <strong class="theCode">SimpleCookie</strong> from the <strong class="theCode">Cookie</strong> header:</p>
                 
                  <p> As a result, you are getting a dictionary with the values passed in the Url:</p>
                 
                   <ul>
                     <li class="theCode"> in_cookie = SimpleCookie(self.headers["Cookie"]) </li>
                     <li class="theCode"> in_data = in_cookie["bearname"].value </li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 <p>Be aware that a request might not have a cookie on it, in which case accessing the <strong class="theCode">Cookie</strong> header will raise a <strong class="theCode">KeyError</strong> exception; or the cookie might not be valid, in which case the <strong class="theCode">SimpleCookie</strong> constructor will raise <strong class="theCode">http.cookies.CookieError</strong>.</p>

                  <blockquote class="blockquote">Important safety tip: Even though browsers make it difficult for users to modify cookies, it's possible for a user to modify a cookie value. Higher-level web toolkits, such as Flask (in Python) or Rails (in Ruby) will cryptographically sign your cookies so that they won't be accepted if they are modified. Quite often, high-security web applications use a cookie just to store a session ID, which is a key to a server-side database containing user information.</blockquote>
                 
                 <blockquote class="blockquote">Another important safety tip: If you're displaying the cookie data as HTML, you need to be careful to escape any HTML special characters that might be in it. An easy way to do this in Python is to use the html.escape function, from the built-in html module!</blockquote>
                 
                 <p>A server that remembers you</p>
                 
                 <p>In this exercise, you'll build a server that asks for your name, and then stores your name in a cookie on your browser. You'll be able to see that cookie in your browser's cookie data. Then when you visit the server again, it'll already know your name.</p>
                 
                 <h3>DNS domains and cookie security</h3>
                 
                 <p>Back in Lesson 1, you used the host or nslookup command to look up the IP addresses of a few different web services, such as Wikipedia and your own localhost. But domain names play a few other roles in HTTP besides just being easier to remember than IP addresses. A DNS domain links a particular hostname to a computer's IP address. But it also indicates that the owner of that domain intends for that computer to be treated as part of that domain.</p>
                 
                 <p> Imagine what a bad guy could do if they could convince your browser that their server evilbox was part of (say) Facebook, and get you to request a Facebook URL from evilbox instead of from Facebook's real servers. Your browser would send your facebook.com cookies to evilbox along with that request. But these cookies are what prove your identity to Facebook … so then the bad guy could use those cookies to access your Facebook account and send spam messages to all your friends.</p>
                 
                 <p>In the immortal words of Dr. Egon Spengler: It would be bad.</p>
                 
                 <p>This is just one reason that DNS is essential to web security. If a bad guy can take control of your site's DNS domain, they can send all your web traffic to their evil server … and if the bad guy can fool users' browsers into sending that traffic their way, they can steal the users' cookies and reuse them to break into those users' accounts on your site.</p>

		     <h2>What HTTPS does for you </h2>
		     <p class="card-text">When a browser and a server speak HTTPS, they're just speaking HTTP, but over an encrypted connection. The encryption follows a standard protocol called Transport Layer Security, or TLS for short. TLS provides some important guarantees for web security:</p>
                 
                 <ul>
                     <li>It keeps the connection <strong class="theCode"> private </strong>by encrypting everything sent over it. Only the server and browser should be able to read what's being sent.</li>
                     <li>It lets the browser <strong class="theCode">authenticate</strong> the server. For instance, when a user accesses <strong class="theCode">https://www.udacity.com/</strong>, they can be sure that the response they're seeing is really from Udacity's servers and not from an impostor.</li>
                     <li>It helps protect the <strong class="theCode">integrity</strong> of the data sent over that connection — checking that it has not been (accidentally or deliberately) modified or replaced.</li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 <blockquote class="blockquote">Note: TLS is also very often referred to by the older name SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Technically, SSL is an older version of the encryption protocol. This course will talk about TLS because that's the current standard.</blockquote>

		     <p class="card-text">Note: In some browser documentation you'll see references to SSL certificates. These are the same as TLS certificates. Remember, SSL is just the older version of the encryption standard.</p>

                 <p> Most Browsers have a lock icon next to the URI when you're viewing an HTTPS web site.</p>
                 <p> Clicking on the lock is how you start exploring the details of the HTTPS connection.</p>
                 
                <h3>What does it mean?</h3>

                 
                 <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>Those are how the browser indicates to the user that their connection is being protected by TLS. However, these dialogs also show a little about the server's TLS setup.</p>
                 </blockquote>
                 
                 
                <h3>Keys and Certificates</h3>
                 
                 
                 <p>The server-side configuration for TLS includes two important pieces of data: <strong class="theCode"> a private key </strong> and <strong class="theCode"> a public certificate </strong>. The private key is secret; it's held on the server and never leaves there. The certificate is sent to every browser that connects to that server via TLS. These two pieces of data are mathematically related to each other in a way that makes the encryption of TLS possible.</p>
                 
                 <p>The server's certificate is issued by an organization called a <strong class="theCode">certificate authority (CA) </strong>. The certificate authority's job is to make sure that the server really is who it says it is — for instance, that a certificate issued in the name of Heroku is actually being used by the Heroku organization and not by someone else.</p>
                 
                 <blockquote class="blockquote">The role of a certificate authority is kind of like getting a document notarized. A notary public checks your ID and witnesses you sign a document, and puts their stamp on it to indicate that they did so.</blockquote>
                 
                 
                  <h3>How does TLS assure privacy?</h3>
                 
                 <p>The data in the TLS certificate and the server's private key are mathematically related to each other through a system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" target="_blank" class="theCode"> public-key cryptography</a>. The details of how this works are way beyond the scope of this course. The important part is that the two endpoints (the browser and server) can securely agree on a shared secret which allows them to scramble the data sent between them so that only the other endpoint — and not any eavesdropper — can unscramble it.</p>
                
                 <h3>How does TLS assure authentication?</h3>
                 
                 <p>A server certificate indicates that an encryption key belongs to a particular organization responsible for that service. It's the job of a certificate authority to make sure that they don't issue a cert for (say) udacity.com to someone other than the company who actually runs that domain.</p>
                 
                 <p>But the cert also contains metadata that says what DNS domain the certificate is good for. The cert in the picture above is only good for sites in the .herokuapp.com domain. When the browser connects to a particular server, if the TLS domain metadata doesn't match the DNS domain, the browser will reject the certificate and put up a big scary warning to tell the user that something fishy is going on </p>
                 
                 <h3>How does TLS assure integrity?</h3>
                 
                 <blockquote class="blockquote">Every request and response sent over a TLS connection is sent with a message authentication code (MAC) that the other end of the connection can verify to make sure that the message hasn't been altered or damaged in transit.</blockquote>
                 
                 <p>If your browser believes the attacker's server is udacity.com, it will send your udacity.com authentication cookies to the attacker's server. They can then put those cookies in their own web client and masquerade as you when talking to the real site. Also, if your browser is fetching content from the attacker's server, the attacker can put whatever they want in that content. They could even forward most of the content from the real server.</p>

                 <p>However, compromising Udacity's site would not allow an attacker to break into your Gmail or Facebook accounts, and fortunately it wouldn't let the attacker blow up your computer either.</p>
                 
                 <p>HTTPS only protects your data in transit. It doesn't protect it from an attacker who has taken over your computer, or the computer that's running your service.</p>

                 <p>The GET Method is really for requesting a copy of a resource and Post is for things that act more or less like form submission. </p>

                 <p>The different HTTP methods each stand for different actions that a client might need to perform upon a server-hosted resource. Unlike <strong class="theCode"> GET </strong> and <strong class="theCode">POST</strong>, their usage isn't built into the normal operation of web browsers; following a link is always going to be a GET request, and the default action for submitting an HTML form will always be a <strong class="theCode">GET</strong> or <strong class="theCode">POST</strong> request.</p>

                 <p>However, other methods are available for web APIs to use, for instance from client code in JavaScript.

The client sends the URI path that it wants to create, and a piece of data in the request body. A server could implement <strong class="theCode">PUT</strong> in a number of different ways — such as storing a file on disk, or adding records to a database. A server should respond to a <strong class="theCode">PUT </strong>request with a <strong class="theCode">201 Created</strong> status code, if the PUT action completed successfully. After a successful <strong class="theCode">PUT</strong>, a <strong class="theCode">GET</strong> request to the same URI should return the newly created resource.</p>

After a <strong class="theCode">DELETE</strong> has happened successfully, further <strong class="theCode">GET</strong> requests for that resource will yield <strong class="theCode">404 Not Found</strong> ... unless, of course, a new resource is later created with the same name!</p>

                 <p>Most applications that involve creating and deleting resources on the server are going to require authentication, to make sure that the client is actually someone we want to trust with that power.</p>

                 <h3>PATCH for making changes </h3>
                 
                 <p>The <strong class="theCode">PATCH</strong> method is a relatively new addition to HTTP. It expresses the idea of patching a resource, or changing it in some well-defined way. (If you've used Git, you can think of patching as what applying a Git commit does to the files in a repository.)</p>
                 
                 <p>However, just as HTTP doesn't specify what format a resource has to be in, it also doesn't specify in what format a patch can be in: how it should represent the changes that are intended to be applied. That's up to the application to decide. An application could send diffs over HTTP <strong class="theCode">PATCH</strong> requests, for instance. One standardized format for <strong class="theCode">PATCH</strong> requests is the <a href="http://jsonpatch.com/" target="_blank" class="theCode"> JSON Patch</a> format, which expresses changes to a piece of JSON data. A different one is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386" target="_blank" class="theCode"> JSON Merge Patch</a>.</p>

                 <h3>HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE for debugging </h3>
                 
                 <p>There are a number of additional methods that HTTP supports for various sorts of debugging and examining servers.</p>
                 
                 <ul>
                 <li> <strong class="tehCode">HEAD</strong>HEAD works just like <strong class="tehCode">GET</strong>, except the server doesn't return any content — just headers.</li>
                 <li> <strong class="tehCode">OPTIONS</strong> can be used to find out what features the server supports.</li>
                 <li> <strong class="tehCode">TRACE</strong> echoes back what the server received from the client — but is often disabled for security reasons.</li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 <p>An HTTP method asks the server to do something to a resource, which is named by a URI.</p>
                 
                 <hr>
                 
                 <h3>Great responsibility</h3>
                 
                 <p>HTTP can't prevent a service from using methods to mean something different from what they're intended to mean, but this can have some surprising effects. For instance, you could create a service that used a GET request to delete content. However, web clients don't expect GET requests to have side-effects like that. In one famous case from 2006, an organization put up a web site where "edit" and "delete" actions happened through GET requests, and <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/articles/The_Spider_of_Doom" target="_blank" class="theCode">the result was that the next search-engine web crawler to come along deleted the whole site</a>.</p>

		     <h2>HTTP/2</h2>
		          <p class="card-text">The new version of HTTP is called HTTP/2. It's based on earlier protocol work done at Google, under the name SPDY (pronounced "speedy").</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, we can't show you very much about HTTP/2 in Python, because the libraries for it are not very mature yet (as of early 2017). We'll still take a look at the motivations for the changes that HTTP/2 brings, though.</p>

                 <p>Some other languages are a little bit more up to the minute; one of the best demonstrations of HTTP/2's advantages is in <a href="https://http2.golang.org/gophertiles" target="_blank" class="theCode">the Gophertiles demo </a> from the makers of the Go programming language. In order to see the effects, you'll need to be using a browser that supports HTTP/2. Check <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=http2" target="_blank" class="theCode"> CanIUse.com</a> to check that your browser does!</p>
                 
                 <blockquote class="blockquote">
                 This demo lets you load the same web page over HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. It also lets you add extra latency (delay) to each request, simulating what happens when you access a server that's far away or when you're on a slow network. The latency options are zero (no extra latency), 30 milliseconds, 200 milliseconds, and one second. Try it out!
                 </blockquote>
                
                 <p>HTTP/2 should load much faster than HTTP/1, if your browser is using it!</p>

		     <h2>Other HTTP/2 demos</h2>
                 
		     <p class="card-text">You don't have to take the Go folks' word for it, either; there's <a href="http://www.http2demo.io/" target="_blank"> http://www.https2demo.io/</a> too, and also <a href="https://http2.akamai.com/demo" target ="_blank" class="theCode">https://http2.akamai.com/demo </a>. Each of these demos works similarly to the Gophertiles demo, and will show you much the same effects. The HTTP/2 one is (on average) a whole lot faster, especially with high latency.</p>

             <p>But why is it faster? To answer that, we first need to look at some browser behavior in HTTP/1.1.</p>
                 
             <hr>
                 
             <h2> Exercise: Multiple connections </h2>
                 
             <p>Since the early days of HTTP, browsers have kept open multiple connections to a server. This lets the browser fetch several resources (such as images, scripts, etc.) in parallel, with less waiting. However, the browser only opens up a small number of connections to each server. And in HTTP/1.1, each connection can only request a single resource at a time.</p>
                 
            <p> As an exercise, take a look at the server in Lesson-3/3_Parallelometer. Try running this server on your computer and accessing it at <a href="http://localhost:8000/" target="_blank" class="theCode">http://localhost:8000</a>to see parallel requests happening. The code here is based on the threading server that you've seen earlier in this lesson. </p>
                
            <p>Depending on your browser, you may see different numbers, but most likely the biggest one you'll see is 6. Common browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari open up as many as six connections to the same server. And under HTTP/1.1, only one request can effectively be in flight per connection, which means that they can only have up to six requests in flight with that server at a time.</p>

                 <h2>Multiplexing</h2>
                <p class="theCode"> requests.get("http://localhost:8000/")</p>
                 
                <p>But if you're requesting hundreds of different tiny files from the server — as in this demo or the Gophertiles demo — it's kind of limiting to only be able to fetch six at a time. This is particularly true when the latency (delay) between the server and browser gets high. The browser can't start fetching the seventh image until it's fully loaded the first six. The greater the latency, the worse this affects the user experience.</p>
                 
                <p>HTTP/2 changes this around by multiplexing requests and responses over a single connection. The browser can send several requests all at once, and the server can send responses as quickly as it can get to them. There's no limit on how many can be in flight at once.</p>
		        
                <p>And that's why the Gophertiles demo loads much more quickly over HTTP/2 than over HTTP/1.</p>

                 <h3>Server push</h3>
                
		        <p>When you load a web page, your browser first fetches the HTML, and then it goes back and fetches other resources such as stylesheets or images. But if the server already knows that you will want these other resources, why should it wait for your browser to ask for them in a separate request? HTTP/2 has a feature called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push" target="_blank" class="theCode">server push</a> which allows the server to say, effectively, "If you're asking for <strong class="theCode"> index.html</strong>, I know you're going to ask for <strong class="theCode"> style.css </strong> too, so I'm going to send it along as well."</p>

                 <h3>Encryption</h3>
                 
                 <p>The HTTP/2 protocol was being designed around the same time that web engineers were getting even more interested in encrypting all traffic on the web for privacy reasons. Early drafts of HTTP/2 proposed that encryption should be required for sites to use the new protocol. This ended up being removed from the official standard … but most of the browsers did it anyway! Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers will only attempt HTTP/2 with a site that is using TLS encryption.</p>
